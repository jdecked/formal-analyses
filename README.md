</p>This is a repo for my first-year university coursework<sup>*</sup> in Formal Analyses (CS50 & CS51). Some code has been modified from the assignments.</p>
<br>
<p><sup>*</sup> - Since Minerva is currently small, I am not worried about people stealing my code. When the university gets larger, I will convert this to a private repo.</p>
